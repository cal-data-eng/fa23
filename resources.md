{:toc}

## Prerequisites

The [Data 100 textbook](http://textbook.ds100.org/), the [CS 61B curriculum](https://datastructur.es/), and the [CS 61A textbook](https://composingprograms.com/) are excellent resources for brushing up on material from the prerequisites.

## Course Notes

The Data 101 course notes (found on the [main page](/)) are a work in progress and are meant to be a resource for you to refer to as you complete assignments. However, they are not a perfect substitute for lectures, as they are a passive resource---meaning you may read something but not understand it the first time. Lectures will have participation and engagement activities to help you practice the material. Please attend!

## SQL

The [PostgresSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html) can be read front to back. Highly recommended!

Other resources from [Data 100](https://ds100.org/), which are intended for SQLite:
+ We've assembled some [SQL Review Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mLVkQxah9asdKhnTNpcUSYBOuKGSWE_d3MJ5nYuTw9U/edit?usp=sharing) to help you brush up on SQL.
+ We've also compiled a list of SQL practice problems, which can be found [here](assets/other/sqlReview.pdf), along with their [solutions](assets/other/sqlReviewSol.pdf).
+ This [SQL Cheat Sheet](https://websitesetup.org/sql-cheat-sheet/) is an awesome resource that was created by Luke Harrison, a former Data 100 student.

## Assignment Tips

See [**Assignment Tips**](/resources/assignment-tips/).

## Exam Resources

There has been exactly one final exam for this course so far, and it was a compressed version due to the UAW 2865 ASE strike in Fall 2022. 

**(updated 12/4/23)** 

|Semester|Final|
|---|---|
|Fall 2022|[Exam](/resources/assets/exams/fa22/fa22_final.pdf) [(Solutions)](/resources/assets/exams/fa22/fa22_final_sol.pdf)|

Final Reference Sheet: [PDF](/resources/assets/exams/fa23/fa23_final_reference_sheet.pdf) Note that this is newly created as of Fall 2023 and will be provided with the paper exam; you should not need to print your own copy. Topics that are not on this reference sheet are still in scope for the final exam. Please post to Ed if you find typos. Thanks!
* **(updated 12/12)** Fixed mongoDB `$group` syntax.

The best way to get a sense for what is needed for our written exam is to attend discussion throughout the semester and work on discussion handouts.

The academic counseling, legal support, financial aid resources and extensive campus referral network provided by USP helps students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university, while empowering a sense of belonging. The program’s mission is to support the advancement of undocumented students within higher education and promote pathways for engaged scholarship.

The [Multicultural Education Program](http://mep.berkeley.edu/) (MEP) is one of six initiatives funded by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund to work towards institutional change and to create a positive campus climate for diversity. The MEP is a five-year initiative to establish a sustainable infrastructure for activities like educational consultation and diversity workshops for the campus that address both specific topics, and to cater to group needs across the campus.

### For basic needs (food, shelter, etc.)
{:.no_toc}
The [Basic Needs Center](https://basicneeds.berkeley.edu/home) (lower level of MLK Student Union, Suite 72) provides support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley.

The [UC Berkeley Food Pantry](https://pantry.berkeley.edu/) (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.
